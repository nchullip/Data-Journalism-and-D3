### Description
This project uses D3.js to visualize some state-level data about population health based on 2014 U.S. Census data.  It similates an on-line newpaper article with an interactive visualization.  Three risk factors (obesity, smoking, and uninsurance rates) are plotted against three perhaps underlying factors (income, poverty rate, and age).


### Running
Due to loading in a csv file, many browsers will fail to load this unless run on an http server.  This project was developed with the `python -m http.server` method.
